            <p class="style">
                Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is the best performer in the R-CNN family of
                image recognition algorithms, including R-CNN and Fast R-CNN. It uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN)
                for feature detection along with a Fast RCNN for image recognition, which makes it a significant upgrade
                over its predecessor (Note: Fast RCNN vs. Faster RCNN). Faster RCNN can process an image under 200ms,
                while Fast RCNN takes 2 seconds or more.

        <h2 class="style">Single Shot Detector (SSD):</h2>
        <div class="grow">
            <p class="style">
                RCNNs draw bounding boxes around a proposed set of points on the image, some of which may be
                overlapping. Single Shot Detectors (SSD) discretize this concept by dividing the image up into default
                bounding boxes in the form of a grid over different aspect ratios. It then combines the feature maps
                obtained from processing the image at the different aspect ratios to naturally handle objects of varying
                sizes. This makes SSDs very flexible, accurate, and easy to train. An implementation of SSD can process
                an image within 125ms.

        <h2 class="style">You Only Look Once (YOLO):</h2>
        <div class="grow">
            <p class="style">
                YOLO stands for You Only Look Once, and true to its name, the algorithm processes a frame only once
                using a fixed grid size and then determines whether a grid box contains an image or not. For this
                purpose, the object detection algorithm uses a confidence metric and multiple bounding boxes within each
                grid box. However, it does not go into the complexities of multiple aspect ratios or feature maps, and
                thus, while this produces results faster, they may be somewhat less accurate than SSD. One of the most
                popular YOLO models is its third version, named YOLOv3. The sleekest variant of YOLO called Tiny YOLO
                can process a video at up to 244 fps or 1 image at 4 ms.
