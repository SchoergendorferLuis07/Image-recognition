                    How do we train a computer to tell one image apart from another image? The process of an image
                    recognition model is no different from the process of machine learning modeling. I list the modeling
                    process for image recognition in Steps 1 through 4.

            <h2 class="style">Modeling Step 1: Extract pixel features from an image</h2>
                <p>
                    First, a great number of characteristics, called features are extracted from the image. An image is
                    actually made of “pixels”, as shown in Figure. Each pixel is represented by a number or a set of
                    numbers — and the range of these numbers is called the color depth. In other words, the
                    color depth indicates the maximum number of potential colors that can be used in an image. In an (8-bit)
                    greyscale image (black and white) each pixel has one value that ranges from 0 to 255. Most images today
                    use 24-bit color or higher. An RGB color image means the color in a pixel is a combination of red,
                    green, and blue. Each of the colors ranges from 0 to 255.

            <h2 class="style">Modeling Step 2: Prepare labeled images to train the model</h2>
                <p>
                    Once each image is converted to thousands of features, with the known labels of the images we can use
                    them to train a model. The more images we can use for each category, the better a model can be trained
                    to tell
                    an image whether is a dog or a fish image. This is called supervised machine learning.
                </p>
            <h2 class="style">Modeling Step 3: Train the model to be able to categorize images</h2>
                <p>
                    The image demonstrates how a model is trained with the pre-labeled images. The huge networks in the
                    middle can be considered a giant filter. The images in their extracted forms enter the input side and
                    the labels are on the output side. The purpose here is to train the networks such that an image with its
                    features coming from the input will match the label on the right.

                <p>
                    Once a model is trained, it can be used to recognize (or predict) an unknown image.
